## Details

A simple landing page built with react, and styled with material UI and Styled Components
MUI provides a robust, customizable, and accessible library of foundational and advanced components, enabling you to build your own design system and develop React applications faster.

Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
Styling Material UI components using Styled Components allows for freedom of expression, The components retain their "ready-made" status, with an addition of desired styling.
